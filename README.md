# Cubic Polynomial Visualizer

## Introduction
Cubic Polynomial Visualizer is a Python application that allows users to visualize cubic polynomial functions interactively. Users can manipulate the coefficients of the polynomial and see how the graph changes in real-time. This tool is useful for students and educators to understand polynomial behavior and its graphical representation.

## Real-World Applications
Cubic polynomials are widely used in various fields:
- Computer Graphics: For creating smooth curves and animations
- Physics: Modeling projectile motion with air resistance
- Engineering: Designing roller coasters and bridge arches
- Economics: Analyzing supply-demand relationships
- Architecture: Creating curved surfaces and structures
- Machine Learning: Polynomial regression for data fitting
